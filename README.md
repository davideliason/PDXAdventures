### Description
PDX Adventures aggregates outdoor activities in the Portland area into a searchable, user-friendly format.  

It uses <a href='https://getcomposer.org/'>Composer</a> to install:
<a href="https://phpunit.de/" target="_blank">PHPUnit</a>, <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Silex</a>, and <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Twig</a>.  It also links to a <a href="http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> CDN for CSS Styling.


# Setup instructions:

To view online: point your browser to <a href="http://pdx-adventures.herokuapp.com"> http://pdx-adventures.herokuapp.com</a>

OR

View on your local machine:

1.  PHP must be installed on your machine (consult other sources for tutorials)

2.  In your terminal:
  1.  Make a directory `mkdir <folder name>`<br>
  2.  Change into that directory `cd <folder name>` <br>
  3.  Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/BabaYaga64/PDXAdventures.git .`<br>
  4. In the top level of the project folder, run `composer install`<br>
  5. Import the database into PostgreSQL. See the Database section to do so.<br>
  6. Change directories into the web folder`cd web`<br>
  7. Start a php server `php -S localhost:8000`
  8. In a web browser window, navigate to `localhost:8000`

## Database
1. Create a new database `CREATE DATABASE pdx_adventure;`<br>
2. Connect to the database `\c pdx_adventure;`<br>
3. Import the database `\i pdx_adventure.sql`<br>
4. If you would like to edit the app and make use of the test database, `CREATE DATABASE pdx_adventure_test WITH TEMPLATE pdx_adventure`<br>
5. NOTE: If the database fails to import (see above), you may manually create it using the following commands:<br>
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pdx_adventure;
 \c pdx_adventure
CREATE TABLE activities (id serial PRIMARY KEY, activity_name int);
CREATE TABLE events (id serial PRIMARY KEY, date_event timestamp, description varchar, event_name varchar, location varchar, user_id int);
CREATE TABLE users (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar, email varchar, phone varchar);
CREATE TABLE activities_events (id serial PRIMARY KEY, activity_id int, event_id int);
CREATE DATABASE pdx_adventure_test WITH TEMPLATE pdx_adventure;
```
## Known bugs
To date, the following need to be updated:<br>
1. The filter will return multiple of the same events if that event has more than one activity lined up with the user's search.
2. The icons on the home page are not all displaying.
3. The top right menu is inconsistently functioning when rendering a mobile layout.
